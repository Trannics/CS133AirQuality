# CS 133 - Air Quality - Term Project  
## Overview  
For our CS 133 Term Project, we performed data analysis and machine learning methods on an air quality-related dataset by @FEDESORIANO on Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/air-quality-data-set)

## Running the Code  
1. Import the .ipynb file ("Eric_Tran,_Thang_Nguyen_Air_Quality_Notebook.ipynb") to Google Colab.
    * You can find the following file in the main GitHub repository directory.
2. Connect to a runtime.
3. Import all related Python modules.
    * Additional modules may be imported for convenience purposes. Though, they may not be used.
4. Under the "Runtime" dropdown, select "Run all".
5. After all related Python modules have successfully been imported, the program will ask the user to import the air quality dataset ("AirQuality.csv") from their local machine.
    * Due to Kaggle's limitations with shared Google Colab, this workaround was implemented.
    * You can find the dataset using the following link:
        * https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/air-quality-data-set
6. The program will complete data cleaning, data analysis, machine learning training, and evaluation processes.
    * Context has been provided below each code block, explaining how each output connects with the asked question.
